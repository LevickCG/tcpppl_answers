The second implementation of Season_io shifts some of the responibility for
maintaining the names of seasons to the system rather than the application
developer. I have mixed feelings on whether this is an appropriate use of the
messages interface. The ability to display seasons seems like a very
application-dependent requirement. Unlike dates, numbers, currency, etc., I've
never seen the requirement before.

It's likely that if an application needs to localize the names of seasons, it
will need to localize a lot of other things too. It may be more appropriate to
use some custom localized string database that can be deployed alongside each
localized version of the app. Strings could be pulled in there and used with a
season facet. I dislike applications that have to change the system
configuration, such as localization files. It's less portable and more prone
to trouble.
