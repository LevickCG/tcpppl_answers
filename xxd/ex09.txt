Rather than implement the answer as directed, I'm going to talk about why this
is a bad idea. I don't believe programs should "guess" the intent of the user
or input; rather, the user should be guided to produce a valid input. For
example, a month drop-down or a field with immediate feedback when something
invalid is input.

Even when dealing with an input such as a text file, trying to guess the
correct meaning of values and catching "most" of the mistakes is a bad idea.
It's only going to lead to trouble. It could be worth writing something to
assist with cleaning up ambiguous dates, but I don't believe this is
appropriate for a locale facet. It would result in surprises, and stream input
functions should not result in surprises.
