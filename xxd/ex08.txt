Date outputs are formatted using a string, so it's quite flexible, but the
"standard" formatting (format 'x') is also the format expected for inputs. On
my system, the only format seems to be the following:

MM/DD/YYYY or MM/DD/YY

It's very strict about the length; MM and DD both have to be two digits, so
it's necessary to pad it with zeros:
01/05/84 or 01/05/1984

On output, the year seems to always be truncated to two digits. Didn't we
learn a lesson about that?
