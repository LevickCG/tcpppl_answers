I took a look at QVector from the Qt library. It provides an interface
extremely similar to the standard vector. 

Qt containers are exception neutral (transparent).

As with standard vector, a valid internal state is always guaranteed (Qt
provides the basic guarantee). However, according to the documentation, for
ALL containers, assignment and copy operations are expected not to throw or
the contents of the container may be unexpected to the user.

In summary, pretty much the same as the standard library.
